The challenge of arranging n queens on a n x n chessboard so that no two 
queens attack one another is known as the "n-queens puzzle."
Return every unique solution to the n-queens puzzle given an integer n. 
The answer can be returned in any sequence.
Every solution has a unique board arrangement for the placement of the n-queens,
where 'Q' and '.' stand for a queen and an empty space, respectively.
Here are the attack rules for N-Queens:
1.Same Row - No two queens can be in the same row.
2.Same Column - No two queens can be in the same column.
3.Same Diagonal (top-left to bottom-right) - No two queens can share the same diagonal 
where (row - col) is equal.
4.Same Anti-Diagonal (top-right to bottom-left) - No two queens can share the same 
anti-diagonal where (row + col) is equal.
